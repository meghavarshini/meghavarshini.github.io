# About Me
Hello! I'm Megh (she/her) a speech enthusiast, specializing in acoustic phonetics. I worked on speech entrainment and phonetic accommodation, L2 speech acquisition, pitch perception and its effects on phonemic identification, and the acoustics of complex tongue gestures. I have also worked on the sound systems of Indic languages like Malayalam, Bangla, Hindi, and Assamese. I enjoy learning about internet linguistcs, encountering Englishes of the world; and composing short, fun language questionaires for my friends on social media!

I have two current research focii. The first is the analysis of phonemic contrast in languages with large phonemic inventories, especially among plosives, to understand how languages systems maintain, store and access tight phonemic contrasts. I also look at the role of secondary acoustic cues and phenomena like neighbourhood density in these processes. The second focus is the modelling of speech entrainment and phonetic accomodation, to find a relationship between convergence in speech patterns and cooperative relationships among speakers.

I am currently employed as a Graduate Research Assistant in the ASIST-ToMCAT projectâ€™s Speech and NLP team, where I  have collaborated on projects related to multimodal modelling of human behaviour, assessment of the performance of ASR transcription services, and with the automatic collection of acoustic features for speech analysis. I have also worked as a Research Assistant in the Douglas Phonetics Lab, University of Arizona; and in the Splang Lab, The English and Foreign Languages University (Hyderabad), where I asisted in running experiments, creating auditory stimuli for forced choice and eye-tracking experiments, designing speech production experiments, and with data analysis and modelling.
