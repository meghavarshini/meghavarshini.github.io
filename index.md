I am a second-year Phd scholar, looking to specialise in speech sciences. I work with articulatory and acoustic linguistics and am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant with the [Douglas Phonetics Lab](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/dpl).


I have worked as a phonetics researcher, a full-time teacher and creator of educational content. I am interested in speech technology, experimental linguistics and ASR.
