<!-- Might want to change "PhD Scholar".
"Hi there!" is transitioning too fast to technical things: "funnel" shape writing: go from broad and easy to understand, to technical things. The tech people will read past the easy stuff an get to the right content. One para for funneling.
Add things parenthetically: this gives wholistic look at your work. No need for masters stuff

Hey there! I am [Megh Krishnaswamy](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/user/meghavarshini-krishnaswamy) (she/her), currently working on a PhD in linguistics from the University of Arizona. As a phonetician, I work on the human speech system. Some of the projects I've worked on investigate the speech acquisition of L2 speakers, the role of pitch perception in the identification of sounds, and the acoustics of complex tongue gestures. I have also worked on the sound systems of Indic languages like Malayalam, Bangla, Hindi, and Assamese. I enjoy learning about internet linguistcs, encountering Englishes of the world; and composing short, fun language questionaires for my friends on social media.

I have two current research focii. The first is the analysis of phonemic contrast in languages with large phonemic inventories, especially among stops, to understand how languages systems maintain, store and access tight phonemic contrasts. I also look at the role of secondary acoustic cues and phenomena like neighbourhood density, in these processes. The second is the modelling of speech entrainment and phonetic accomodation, to find a relationship between convergence in speech patterns and cooperative relationships among speakers.


<!-- describe research focii more easily and why it is interesting and important. What are the applications and broader questions. "this is just who i am" language, casual. "during my masters I did this. . . "
I have research experience in the areas of ASR, articulatory and  acoustic phonetics, and speech perception. -->
I am currently employed as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [ASIST-ToMCAT project's](https://ischool.arizona.edu/news/new-asisttomcat-grant) Speech and NLP team, where I work have assisted on work on multimodal . I have also worked as a Research Assistant in the [Douglas Phonetics Lab](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/dpl), University of Arizona; and in the [Splang Lab](https://duttalab.github.io), The English and Foreign Languages University (Hyderabad), where I asisted in running experiments, creating auditory stimuli for forced choice and eye-tracking experiments, designing speech production experiments, and with data analysis and modelling.

I am a [Teach for India](https://www.teachforindia.org) aluminus, and have served low-income communities in Old City, Hyderabad as a full-time primary and middle school teacher. I am committed to making education accessible in the medium suited to the community, and language instruction that sees children as language scientists. With this aim, I have also worked on making educational content in Hindi more student-friendly and jargon-free during my internship at Karadi Path Education company. I also have experience facilitating school enrollments and with door-to-door information dissemination on childrens' right to free education in India.  

 <!-- I am interested in speech technology, experimental linguistics and ASR.-->

# Work Experience
### Phonetics and Phonology:
#### Ongoing:

1. Studying acquisition patterns for three-way novel contrasts among naive listeners: This project aims to assess the effects of articulatory complexity on the perception of Malayalam dental, alveolar and retroflex stops on monolingual speakers with one coronal stop in their language (such as English or Mandarin), to test if more gestural complexity can alleviate the lack of familirity of sounds as listers attempt to distinguish between the tree stops.
2. Analysing phonological aspects of vowel harmony in Mongolian: this is a replication experiment to assess the effect of phonology-driven vowel harmony on the vowel space of Mongolian speakers.  
3. Automating transcription repair using phonemic edit distance and feature similarity: this tool attempts to extract key domain words from automatic transcripts, by calculating (phonological) feature similarity between the target words and the mis-transcribed words, using levenstein distance. It tests if transcripts can be corrected by interveneing at the sound level.
4. Comparing the efficiency of speech perception data among different online platforms:  

#### Previous:
1. Coarticulation aids lexical access in three-way Malayalam coronal contrast
2. Effects of articulatory contraints on the acoustics of voiced geminate stops in Bengali
3. Effects of word error rate on modelling multimodal tasks

### Pedagogy and advocacy
1. Graduate Teaching Asistant, LING 150: I was responsible for leading weekly discussion sections for students on the linguistics sub-discipline under discussion that week, and as a grader for my section of the class.
